-- the relations in the oop concepts is divided into :
- association and it is a use relation and means class a use class b to do specific task
- aggregiation and it is a has relation and thats means inside class a structure itself "class a constructor " there is class b object used inside it
  so we can say that the every aggregiation can be considered as a association but not vice versa
  and the composition differ from the aggregiation in the part of if the parent is died all the childs will be dead too and thats make the composotion is special type from the aggregiation so we can imagine the big group is the association and inside it there is special subset is called aggregiations and inside it too there is another special subset which is the composition .
